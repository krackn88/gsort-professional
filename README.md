### Password Evolution Simulator

Our revolutionary Password Evolution Simulator is based on extensive research into how users typically modify their passwords when prompted to change them. The simulator applies realistic patterns:

- **Incremental Changes** (70-80% of users): Adding or incrementing numbers, changing a single character
- **Seasonal/Temporal Patterns** (15-20% of users): Adding month/year or seasonal references
- **Character Substitution** (40-50% of users): Changing letters to similar-looking numbers/symbols
- **Structure Preservation** (80-90% of users): Maintaining the same basic structure and length

This feature is invaluable for:
- Security researchers testing password policies
- Creating realistic test datasets for authentication systems
- Understanding user behavior and improving security guidance

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB+ recommended for large datasets
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended
- **Storage**: 200MB for installation, plus space for your data files
